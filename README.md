The account details are in the data.txt file, refer to the existing account details for test cases or create a new account to test cases. To run the program, execute the Main class in the ‘src’ folder. The ATM has 50000 money initially and is reset every time the program is started. Every time a deposit or withdrawal is made, the amount is updated while the program is running. To test for the condition if the ATM has insufficient cash to withdraw, the test account should have a balance of more than 50000 when the program is started as deposits add money to the ATM balance.
